# BMP

Files BMP_ECB.c, BMP_CBC.c, and BMP_CTR all encrypt and decrypt a BMP file with their respective modes.

You can run each one individually by entering "gcc 'filename'.c" followed by "./a.out".

encrypt.bmp will change every time you use a different mode ensuring that the encryption works.

decrypt.bmp should always remain the same as SD.bmp ensuring that the decryption works.
